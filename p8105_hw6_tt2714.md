## Problem 1

#### Data cleaning…

A city\_state variable is created to combine the two columns city and
state. Four cities that do not report victim race are removed.
Disposition, victim\_race, and victim\_sex columns are coded into binary
variables.

``` r
homicide = read_csv(file = "./homicide-data.csv") 
homicide_citystate = homicide %>% 
  unite(city_state, c(city, state), sep = ", ", remove = T) %>% 
  filter(!grepl('Dallas|Phoenix|Kansas City|Tulsa', city_state)) %>% 
  mutate(disposition = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white")) %>% 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), 
         victim_sex = as.factor(victim_sex),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white")) 
```

#### Logistic Regression Model for Baltimore, MD

Outcome: disposition of homicide  
Reference group: race - white  
Predictors: sex and age

Use `broom::tidy` to clean up the model and include odds ratio with
confidence intervals.

``` r
baltimore = homicide_citystate %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
baltimore_glm = glm(disposition ~ victim_race + victim_age + victim_sex, 
                    data = baltimore, family = binomial())

baltimore_glm %>% 
  broom::tidy(., conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(odds.ratio = exp(estimate),
         conf.low = exp(conf.low),
         conf.high = exp(conf.high)) %>% 
  kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                  | estimate | std.error | statistic | p.value | conf.low | conf.high | odds.ratio |
| :-------------------- | -------: | --------: | --------: | ------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: |
| (Intercept)           |    1.186 |     0.235 |     5.055 |   0.000 |    2.076 |     5.212 |      3.274 |
| victim\_racenon-white |  \-0.820 |     0.175 |   \-4.694 |   0.000 |    0.312 |     0.620 |      0.441 |
| victim\_age           |  \-0.007 |     0.003 |   \-2.142 |   0.032 |    0.987 |     0.999 |      0.993 |
| victim\_sexMale       |  \-0.888 |     0.136 |   \-6.525 |   0.000 |    0.315 |     0.537 |      0.412 |

#### Regression on all cities

Logistic regression on all cities with odds ratio and confidence
intervals.

``` r
cities_glm = homicide_citystate %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(models = map(data, ~glm(disposition ~ victim_race + victim_age + victim_sex, data = .x)),
         models = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-data) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  mutate(odds.ratio = exp(estimate),
         conf.low = exp(estimate - std.error * 1.96),
         conf.high = exp(estimate + std.error * 1.96)) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-white")
```

``` r
cities_glm %>% ggplot(aes(color = reorder(city_state, odds.ratio))) +
  geom_point(aes(x = reorder(city_state, odds.ratio), y = odds.ratio)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = city_state, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  coord_flip() + ggtitle("Adjusted odds ratio of non-white to white in each city") +
  xlab("city") + ylab("adjusted odds ratio") + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6), legend.position = "none") 
```

## Problem 2

``` r
birthweight = read_csv(file = "./birthweight.csv")
birthweight_new = birthweight %>% 
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace),
         malform = as.factor(malform))
```

This dataset consists of 20 variables on a child’s birthweight. There is
a total of 4342 entries of children data. The data is prepared for
regression analysis with appropriate format and no missing data.

#### Regression Model for Birthweight

I am using a step-wise regression (backward direction) for variable
selection, as we have 19 variables available for birthweight prediction.

``` r
model_1 = lm(bwt ~ ., data = birthweight_new)
stepwise_1 = step(model_1, direction = 'backward')
```

#### Additional Models

Predictors: length at birth and gestational age

Head circumference, length, sex and all
